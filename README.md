RoleX: Empowering Secure User Roles

RoleX is a sophisticated and secure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system built with FastAPI. This project enables seamless management of user roles and permissions for applications, ensuring that users can only access resources and perform actions they are authorized to, based on their roles. 

With RoleX, developers can easily manage access control, implement secure user authentication, and enforce role-based permissions to create highly secure and user-friendly systems.

Key Features
- Role-Based Access: Defines and manages multiple roles (Admin, Moderator, User) with distinct permissions.
- JWT Authentication: Secure user login and session management using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Fine-Grained Access Control: Restricts access based on the user’s role to various application features.
- Modular Design: Easily extendable to accommodate additional roles, permissions, and functionality.
- Database Integration: Fully integrates with SQLAlchemy to manage users and their roles.

 Technologies Used
- FastAPI: Fast and modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.
- SQLAlchemy: Object Relational Mapper (ORM) for database interactions.
- Pydantic: Data validation and settings management.
- JWT (JSON Web Tokens): Provides secure authentication and authorization for users.
- Uvicorn: Fast ASGI server for serving FastAPI applications.
